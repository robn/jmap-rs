*ARCHIVED*. JMAP as released looks nothing like this anymore. This is not going to help you at all.

# jmap-rs

A JMAP parser/generator in Rust

## What is JMAP?

JMAP is the JSON Mail Access Protocol, an API for accessing mail, calendars and
contacts on a server. In simple terms its a HTTP+JSON replacement for IMAP,
CalDAV and CardDAV. See [jmap.io](http://jmap.io/) for more info.

## What is jmap-rs?

Everything you need to parse, generate and manipulate JMAP data structures from
Rust. Its what you need if you're writing a JMAP server or client.

[salada](https://github.com/robn/salada) is a JMAP server that uses this
library.

## Status

Tracking the JMAP spec as at 2016-02-29.

Currently can round-trip JMAP Contact, ContactGroup, Calendar, CalendarEvent
and Mailbox objects and CRUD methods into the corresponding Rust structures and
back. More is being added as required by client projects (mainly salada).
